# Prints random lines from file
AMOUNT=$1
FILENAME=$2
LINES=`wc -l $FILENAME | cut -d ' ' -f1`

NUMBER=`expr $LINES \/ 100 \* $AMOUNT`

for ((i=0;i<$NUMBER;i++));
    do
        OUTPUT=$(($RANDOM % $LINES))
        echo `head -$OUTPUT $FILENAME | tail -1`
    done

Explanation: AMOUNT and FILENAME hold the command line input variables. LINES grabs the number of lines in the file, and NUMBER divides the lines by 100 and then multiplies it by AMOUNT to get the percentage of lines that will be printed. Then, using a for loop ({0..$NUMBER} didn't work so I used C syntax instead), call RANDOM and then mod it by LINES in order to get a random line number in that range, then use head | tail to output that specific line.

Now, for the first time, this course is available, fully adapted for the American climate, conditions and indigenous plantings, for the american gardener. <br /> <br />This book is a distillation of the courses, and as such is a complete master class in planning and realizing the perfect garden. Its principles and approach are fully applicable to garden planning virtually anywhere in the western world. The essence of the course is to start from the basics of the site, soil, and climatic conditions before designing the structure of the garden and its planting schemes. Other sections of the book deal with construction and practical gardening. Finally the principles of design are applied to special projects such as conservatories, roof gardens, and water gardens. <br /> <br />The text is profusely illustrated with diagrams, line artwork, and full color photography, accompanied by easy-to-follow plans. In providing a comprehensive course in garden design this book, employing the professional expertise of the school, is different from any other for it treats the concept and realization of a garden in its totality. <br /> <br /> 2005-10-03

Reading the \\"Laughing Jesus\\" has released me even more from the bondage of fundmentalism. I grew up in a \\"fundie\\" church and thought from the get go I was domed to hell despite what I did to make my life better. Nothing seemed to work...I was so full of guilt and shame all the time that it drove me crazy. I have seen in many people were this has caused a mental disorder. We could deplete much of the world problems if everyone was to \\"love each other\\" and not so tied up in the literal world. We can change the world if we all work together and change lives and lived Lucidly but we must start to change now and we can live better lives. I am not meaning we all get more money but we have peace of mind and heart and not be so judemental on each on every little thing we do. May ya all find the peace that ya are looking for. 2005-09-27
US 40204093 RVXRIA9CC9L6X 1586086855 27988664 When Night Falls Books 4 14 15 N Y Synopsis By the time the scientific expedition from Earth reaches Nardyl, they find devastation instead of the advanced civilization they had expected-a world where the survivors now live, or die, by the sword. Tessa becomes the spoils of war-the female taken captive by the strongest male. From the moment she sees them, Tessa is certain this race of beings has visited Earth in the distant past. Not only do they bear an unnerving resemblance to ancient man's concept of evil in fleshly form-Satan-but Lucien possesses the power to bend her completely to his will and `possess' her with the carnal pleasure only he can give her-or withhold from her. <br />Rating: Contains violence, graphic sex and explicit language, mild BDSM and profanity. <br /> 2005-10-12

On a scale of 1-5, I rate this book a 4, because of its immortal lessons beneath the cover. This book presents extremeties to which there is no hurt or pain, but also no love or true happiness. <br /> <br />Jonas, the main character, is a boy who has entered his time to be \\"chosen\\" for his assigned job in his completely controlled community. He is chosen as \\"The Receiver\\", which is the most honored job in the community. \\"The Receiver\\" holds all memories to which the society over the years has chosen to do away with- all the memories which make life unique, including color, and most feelings and emotions. Throughout the book we see Jonas emerge and realize these emotions are essential to a fulfilled life, even if the good comes with the bad. 2005-10-03

I felt the way that the main characters worked out the various situations they found themselves in, particularly in the later chapters, could have been strenghtened with more detail and conclusiveness. <br /> <br />Overall I found the book very enlighting and difficult to lay down as the various plots and charaters developed. <br /> <br />I would certainly recommend it for everyone interested in \\"end time\\" prophecies. 2005-10-03

On page 38 author Bradbury says, \\"When people ask me where I get my ideas, I laugh. How strange, we are so busy looking out to find ways and means, we forget to look in.\\" From his own life, he recounts events and memories that years later became subject matter for his own writing--and suggestions for how he, as a writer, pewrsonally captured those memories and events and worked them into stories to share with the world. <br /> <br /> This book is chock full of excellent writing advice, yet it is short and convenient to read. Bradbury urges writers to put their ideas into writing with zest, gusto, and fun, about subjects they either love or hate, either in a whisper or roar. He urges writers to stay true to themselves. <br /> <br /> Like you probably have, I have read several books on writing. This is one of the best ones for me! <br /> <br /> 2005-10-05
US 52172264 R1U284D6QRKHQR 0716727250 177421894 The Quark and the Jaguar: Adventures in the Simple and the Complex Books 2 10 18 N N Complexity theme is contrived; superficial coverage of many subjects Gell-Mann went to much effort to weave the diverse topics of this book together under the theme of complex adaptive systems. I found this to be a pointless endeavor. A good theme should provide cohesion or make the subject more approachable. Conceiving of both a single-celled organism and a culture as complex adaptive systems, however, provides little insight into the functioning of either and serves mostly to drive home the point that the notion of a complex adaptive system is so broad that nearly anything worth discussing falls under that heading. <br /> <br />Quantum physics is discussed at length. Unfortunately this section reads more like a catalog of concepts and discoveries than like a good introduction conveying key concepts. Other subjects (biology, evolution, ecosystems, computer learning, economics, public policy) are covered too superficially to yield anything of interest. <br /> <br />The major arguments of _The Quark and the Jaguar_ are as follows: <br /> <br />1) Effective complexity is not the same as algorithmic complexity. Algorithmic complexity is 0 for uniform data and highest for completely random data. (Potential) effective complexity is highest in the middle, where patterns and rules (schema) can be derived and minimal for both uniform data and random data. <br /> <br />2) Classical physics implies a deterministic world. How can anything interesting happen? Because quantum physics offers randomness. <br /> <br />3) Complex adaptive systems create schemas to model the data. This is true for the formation of life, to children learning to speak, to scientific progress, etc. Successful complex adaptive systems are solutions to problems. So the biological and cultural diversity on the planet represents a huge amount of valuable information. <br /> <br />4) We should preserve biological and cultural diversity so we don't lose valuable information. 2005-10-13
US 35771631 RG5FVBHB05CQ 0671720244 751765365 Insurrection (Starfire) Books 4 3 4 N N An Ugly Civil War Insurrection takes place in the same universe as IN DEATH GROUND and THE SHIVA OPTION about a generation after the events of the latter. Humanity has been at peace but that doesn't stop nasty politicians from trying to do nasty things to people. Finally, a time comes when the people will take it no more and the result is civil war. <br /> <br />This book makes clear that there are honorable people on both sides of the conflict but the horrors of war are such that innocents are bound to suffer. Like the other books of this series, the action sequences are well though out and well written but the main lessons come from choices faced by the protagonists. Weber and White are good at writing about space battle. They are even better at writing about political issues and human choices. <br /> 2005-10-08
US 12197312 R295APDO90F42L 1401013465 686366941 1-2: Champion Guides I Books 5 1 2 N N A great book which should change society After reading \\"champion guides\\" I feel I know all I need about psychology and what makes people tick. I took alot of psychology when I was in college--don't expect this to be the same. This is not traditional psychology but a new look at the forces of today's society and how dysfunctional family systems can make one crazy! How our own bad habits ruin our life and especially how we should eat. I am no longer afraid of dietary fat--I know it makes me slim, and I love the daily fasting routine. The way she puts it makes so much common sense. I wish I could say it right here but you should just get the book. It will change your life. She hits all facets--it makes think about things differently. She especially appeals to youth, but also to \\"elders\\" in \\"elder consciousnessness\\" and also dieters in \\"fasting consciousness\\" and \\"swine consciousness\\" sticks in my mind right now. I like the chapter \\"ageless cornucopia\\" and for the first time I don't fear aging--I \\"hold my head up high\\" and speak the truth to youth. That I think is her biggest contribution. 2005-09-28
US 38726774 R1AK56STKMG2WJ 1594110158 342484164 Turning It Around Books 5 3 3 N N Simple, yet profound This book \\"spoke to me\\" in a way that not many others have. It approaches many of the current social issues of inequality, education, the poor, gender, drugs, crime, and a society that has largely rejected truth and morality. In his book, Bill Allin lays the ground work for those who know they need to better their world, but are overwhelmed by the task and don't know where to begin. He makes his points without self-righteousness or preaching and opened my eyes to the fact that people around the world not only share the same general beliefs and value systems that we do, but that they also have the same social problems. <br /> <br />I found Turning It Around to be simple yet profound -- a refreshing breath of fresh air offering unique perspectives. The author does not advocate giving up anything, but rather, shows that learning things in a different order beginning in early childhood, can make a positive difference in our families, our communities and ultimately, in the world of the future. <br /> <br />Allin decries the fact that we don't teach much about what life is, to our young people. Instead, we insist on keeping them innocent as children for as long as possible, then wonder why they can't cope with the stresses of adulthood when they grow up. Turning It Around encourages teaching children what it means to be an adult and how to cope with adult situations before they are in crisis, rather than trying to repair the damage afterwards. <br /> <br />I'd recommend this book to anyone who truly cares about children and is interested in teaching them principles that will last a lifetime. With its revolutionary approach to today's problems, Turning It Around should become must reading for parents, educators, professionals and politicians. 2005-09-30

I read it to my daughter, and though she enjoyed matching up the stickers to the pages, she said, \\"I don't like that story--let's read the other one again instead!\\" I would recommend the book Jewel the Unicorn for young children over this one. 2005-09-30
US 12166099 R3QA2D6C9NNIHF 0141300493 711635514 Deadly, Unna? Books 5 4 4 N N The true review of deadly unna? First of all, I would like to say that this book is not for everyone. This book is not well-understood by those who gave it horrible reviews- Deadly Unna? is worth much more. This book is quite deep, and has many metaphors. <br /> <br />Neither is this book for those who prefer fairy-tale endings. This book is the truth, about issues and morals that are hidden from sight. <br />The only thing that I didn't like, was the amount of stereotypical people that were introduced- though this did make the book better understood. <br /> <br />Phillip Gwynne has put something special into this book. I cannot describe what this special thing is, because there are no words in the English language to describe it. That special thing leaves you awestruck, feeling that you are there, watching and listening the happenings, instead of reading them off paper. It makes you cry with the characters, and laugh. <br /> <br />This book does have plot. It just takes a deeper eye to understand it. Don't try to fight it. <br /> <br />I would advise the reader to read the sequel, Nukkin ya, because you will be asking for more. 2005-10-01

I absolutly loved it from the first to the last page! I picked up this book because of my honors english class, we were to choose a book we felt comfortable reading for class during independent reading. At first i picked it up because I am absolutly obsessed with dogs. Come to find out the book is not even really about dogs. But it grew on me. Reading a book about someones life and how they were alone. All Sarah needed was someone to care about her and love her the way she was. In which she wasnt happy with her ex-husband Kevin in which they got a divorce. I felt kind of a personal connection to her. I want people to except me and love me just the way I am. I could almost put myself in Sarah shoes even though i am only 16 years old. Claire did an absolutly wonderful job writing this book, I just couldnt put it down at times. I read the book in 2 weeks exactly. I am looking forward to reading her other book, in which i hope is just as great as this one (im sure it will be).. But there was one downsize to this book, the ending. I think it ended on a very low point. It kind of made me want to read more about it even though that was the end of the book. I think it was great though how Sarah ended up with someone she really liked. So overall this book is one of my favorites, and I will recommend it to everyone I know. Thanks Jenn 2005-09-29

I find it hard to believe that those of us who live normal, 9 to 5 lives, could ever live up to Ms. Stoddard's expectations. Some of her suggestions are just plain ridiculous for those of us who are on a limited budget. It is plainly obvious, not only with this book, but some of Ms. Stoddard's other books, that she and her husband Peter spare no expense with their lavish life-style. Two homes, trips to Paris, beautiful clothing, yadda, yadda, yadda. I guess they are happy!!!! She needs to come down to earth and realize there are people out there who can not afford Porthault lines, or Roger Muhl paintings. I guess she wouldn't be caught dead sleeping on linens from that fabulous French store \\"JC Pen-NAY\\". Does she have any suggestions for those of us who struggle to make ends meet and keep our heads above water? I think I will send her a quarter, so she can go buy a clue! Thank heavens this book is returnable because it goes back today. 2005-10-06

Matthias is recognized as a hero for \\"accidentally\\" saving a guards life. With all eyes on Matthias, is there anyway he can escape to save his friends lives? Matthias and a group of undercover kids form an escape plan, but will a group of kids be able to escape a place filled with their enemy, and will they escape in time to save his friend's lives? <br /> <br /> I thought this was a very well rounded book. It gave excellent details and gave u a very good visual picture. I thought the author did a good job with keeping you interested; she had many cliffhangers at the end of the chapters. She held onto the stories of the first five books and also added more to keep you interested. <br /> <br /> If you read the first five books, you will love this one. This book was always keeping me on my toes and it was even more thrilling and adventures than the last five. If you love adventurous, fiction books, this is the book for you! I defiantly recommending you to read the whole series instead of just one because with her books moving at the rate they do, you will never be able to keep up and follow along. <br /> 2005-09-29

Shelters is a must-own classic. I treasure my copy, and I am actually came to the amazon site today to buy 3 copies of this book, one to donate to my Church library, one for a Christmas gift for a carpenter friend, and one to complement my first edition of this book. This book was first released in 1973 by Shelter Press. If this book is of interest, check out the other books from them.<br /><br />This is a big, oversize paperback the size of a road atlas. Every page packed with great drawings, photos or diagrams. I never get tired of browsing through the pictures, reading some of the stories, and getting inspiration to go out and build a shelter, a home, for a planned or unplanned need to build a place to live; this book covers expedient shelters of many types.<br /><br />I have yet to see a better book on this subject, it is simply a fantastic reference and a joy to read. This is not a book simply on construction methodology, this is a book about people building shelter to reflect available materials, tools, budget, and most of all culture. 2005-10-01

This book is great. I know that people still in MS and HS will find Ch3 (\\"The Locker and Backpack\\") helpful, but for me Ch 4 (\\"Traveling Paper\\") and 5 (\\"The Desktop Filing System\\") were the most helpful. Ms. Goldberg outlined how to go about setting up a system that WORKS FOR YOU and made it budget-friendly. It's easy to take the suggestions she gives for MS students and apply them to the (slightly different) needs of a college student or working adult. When I go to bed at night I feel much more settled knowing that I am organized and prepared not just for the next day or week, but for the whole semester. UPDATE: This book is still a staple of my books on organizing, though for those in the professional world (and perhaps even in middle or high school) \\"Getting Things Done\\" is the Bible of managing all the moving pieces of life. 2005-10-14

Yes, economics is sometimes quite the opposite of what one might think and is very often \\"politically inviable\\" because of its conclusions, but Mr. Landsburg goes far too much into the rhelm of \\"I'm the author, you have to do what I say.\\" I, too, agree that, for example, enviromental policies are often extremely ineffecient. However, if these policies are important to others, if they bring happiness or, in other words, \\"utility\\" to a degree greater than the opportunity costs incured, that's their business. The book is scattered with his belittlement of the poor idiots who don't understand economics and if they did they would think like him. <br /> <br />This is the sort of reason why people don't like econmists. This is why people think we're heartless prigs. If the people through whom this book must have gone before it was published knew enough about economics to defend their positions instead of just accepting the author as their better, they would have perhaps reminded him to tone down some of his particulars that he forms into generalities. <br /> <br /> <br />To summize: Mr. Landsburg is an insufferable know-it-all, who does, in all fairness, know-it-some. 2005-10-03

A burning house, three dead bodies and a missing baby set the stage to once again plunge Lindsay, Jill, Cindy and Claire into another case of murder and suspense. These three women have been to hell and back together and have grown and matured. I love the way Patterson has developed these heroines and has invested enough time and effort into each personality that you care about what happens to each of them.<br /><br /> This time the girls are dealing with a killer who strikes every three days and it becomes a race to try to catch the killer and keep the body count at a minimum. On top of the frantic need to catch a murderer, one of the women is harboring a deep, dark secret, that will prove fatal. Which Murder Club member is it and what will happen to her?

While it is often easier to stick with the authors you know and love, how very nice it is to stumble upon a new talent. A friend led me to Jenna Petersen's website where she was sharing an audience participation story called \\"Her Every Desire\\" and I was absolutely hooked by the author's delightful writing style and characterization. Enough so that I went on a pilgrimage to find Scandalous when it was released last week. The story of Katherine and Dominic is rich and complex and I found tears in my eyes as I reached the ending. The secondary love story was a lovely sweet counterpoint to the main characters as they struggled to face and overcome their own demons before finding their happy ending. Loved the good guys. Hated the villainous brother and his manipulative wife.(the only fault I found was that I wished for a more unhappy ending for that pair - they certainly deserved it!) This book was definitely a keeper! 2005-10-07

It was a beautiful story from the viewpoint of a young girl and her life from childhood to adolescence. Every chapter seemed to be separate story, but it was all related to one thing which was Esperanza's poor life on Mango Street. She wrote what she saw and what she thought. Her strong feelings told us she wanted to change her bad situation. Even though she was just a little girl, she knew exactly what she wanted. She wanted to move out from Mango Street, a place of poverty. She wanted her own house; she wanted to have a better life. She wanted to get a good education by working to save money to go to a good school. She was told to keep writing by her aunt and that that would keep her free. I liked the chapter, \\"Four Skinny Trees\\". Esperanza used four trees as models. She was brave to struggle with life just like the skinny trees. The four skinny trees' strength was hidden. They were their ferocious roots beneath the ground. The roots grew everywhere and grabbed at the earth and gave strength to the trees. They never gave up. That taught Esperanza to be strong like the trees, to never give up. Because the book was meant to have been written by a 10-year-old girl, it was sometimes difficult to understand what her feelings were. <br /> Maybe she didn't know how could changer her life, but her aunt told her to keep writing to get free in one day, and she didn't care to work to save money to go to a good school. She thought marriage couldn't escape the poor life. She wanted to be independent. She wanted to have her own house. she gave an example of her friend, Sally. Sally's father beat her so badly. Esperanza thought Sally got married in order to escape, but marriage didn't bring her a better life. <br /> <br /> 2005-10-04

US 50632571 R2FNVEMSBRXB5E 037582670X 342317933 Eldest (Inheritance, Book 2) Books 3 23 39 N N Loses Momentum I loved the first book, Eragon. It surprised me though, thatI indeed enjoyed it, because of the title being so very similar to Tolkien's Aragon. I thought, probably like many, what kind of cheesy foolish repeat or 'Ode to Tolkien' can this be? But low and behold I was wrong. It proved to have a heart of its own and one with its very own creative pulse. It had a simple yet deeply enticing grace that seemed to sweep me away. I was thoroughly entertained, and impressed, save for the last predictable battle scene, which left a little to be desired. Eragon seemed to lose steam towards the end. It became more 'actiony' and 'predictable', and less naturally enticing. <br /> <br /> And that should have warned me to have lower expectations for the second book. It is very difficult to continue one's success with \\"series\\" fiction. I commend Rowling, Tolkien, and many others for succesfully doing such. This second book definitely trails off. It loses its speed, and strands itself in a sea of tedious boredom, predictability, and bland complexities. <br /> <br /> Eldest seems to grow an opinionated outside critique on life. It doesnt't feel natural at all, nor does it fit in with the initial heart of the story that compelled me in. I can hear way too much of the author's voice, and opinions in this. And it feels forced. It doesn't make any logical sense that the Elves who deal with \\"magic, energy, and a deep love of nature\\" would be \\"Athiests\\" or \\"Agnostics\\". I have no problem with Athiesm, nor Agnosticism, but it simply doesn't fit here. It feels out of place, and forced. I wonder if the author, being as young as he is, is unaware of various ideas of spirituality, religion besides beliefs in a \\"Personal God\\", or \\"Personal gods\\". This was just one problem, out of many that I found in the book. But basically it is none of the little problems that I found troubling rather then the simple fact that the story in the second book is just not that good. <br /> It is sad because Eldest in a way very much diminishes Eragon. The whole entire story has taken on this \\"video game-like\\" quality where the characters have a certain amount of energy that builds up, gets depleted, and is restored. It feels at times like I am watching someone else play a fantasy video game. And, as we all know, that is not anyone's idea of a fun. <br /> <br /> I really wish that I didn't read this second book, for as I said before, it is no where close to as good as the first. I probably won't read the third. I will forget, by then, about how compelling the first book was, and will still have a sour taste in my mouth from this second book. <br /> If you thought that the first book was absolutely excellent then give this one a try. It is mildly interesting, and your passion for the initial book should propel you through to the end...which again was quite predictable. But if you found the first book to be average, or even slightly above average then I would recommend staying away from this book. It is no \\"Godfather 3\\" but it's pretty close. 2005-10-12

This book fits in nicely between reference works like Eric Meyers \\"Cascading Style Sheets: The Definitive Guide\\" and technique books like Dan Cederholm's \\"Bulletproof Web Design\\". At first glance, this rather unassuming book contains pretty basic information about the applications of CSS. However, this book deserves a careful reading, as it is packed with excellent explanations and examples. <br /> <br />\\"Cascading Style Sheets\\" isn't full of flashy illustrations, but the examples are well thought out and present the ideas well. The chapter on layout (\\"Boxes, Boxes, Boxes\\") contains the best explanation I have seen on how layout boxes function in CSS. If you've been wrestling with understanding the difference between absolute and relative positioning, and how to use these values to make stable layouts, this book is for you. <br /> <br />The chapter on typography is an excellent resource for developers who may not have had the chance to study this essential subject. The authors present theory and application of good typographic practice (which is often ignored in current web design). <br /> <br />The chapter on browser bugs (\\"Cross-browser CSS\\") summarizes the current knowledge on cross-browser compatibility very well, and provides rock-solid workarounds for those thorny problems. <br /> <br />Last but not the least, the chapter \\"CSS Design Projects\\" will give you some solid examples to apply to your own designs. <br /> <br />There's quite a few good books out there right now on CSS, and quite a few not-so-good books; how is one to choose? Well, this book should be at the top of your shopping list--it's a rich, detailed, and extremely well-written book about the subtle craft of web design with CSS. 2005-10-11

US 51618877 RIHEK41XWOK54 0679728759 53277980 Blood Meridian: Or the Evening Redness in the West Books 5 5 6 N N Simply amazing. This western is just different from any other, because it is so apocolyptic for lack of a better word. These characters are riding to the seemy ends of the earth where only savages and the macabre can exist, and to the people that were there, that must be what it felt like. The beauty of it is that the author never once imposes his character's feelings on you, just the sheer weight of his descriptiveness puts you there. <br />The most amazing thing about this book, as that while the details are fictionalized, the amount of violence that these men wrought is probably not exaggerated, and only an almost surreal approach to the violence like this could do it justice. But the book isn't like other westerns where the violence is made to be cool or stylish. Somehow the author mananaged to drench almost every page in blood, guts, and grime, without becoming gratuitous... and its sad, its just a very sad book about a forgotten, dark corner of history. I don't think I've ever felt so empty after reading any other book. It'll shake your faith in humanity, if you had any to begin with. 2005-09-30

It is a \\"great read.\\" But more importantly, Mr. Stamper has written an exciting, thought-provoking and unapologetically personal book because he clearly wants to \\"make a difference.\\" He writes about how to have a better-paid, better-trained, well-educated police force. He wants to see a greater emphasis on prevention of crime by improving how society deals with poverty, domestic violence and an archaic punitive system, and he actually offers interesting solutions which will make the reader think. <br /> <br />To make his points, he risks exposing his own early personal errors and continuous learning. Some of this is hilarious; some of it, tragic. Now a phd., Mr. Stamper was an uninformed teenager when he entered the force. By daring to use his personal story as a vehicle to expose both the virtues and flaws of law-enforcement, he reaches both the mind and the heart. There is nothing self-serving here. Rather, it is a daring risk, inviting criticism from those who fear change and want an excuse to close their minds and shut the door to progress. <br /> <br />An index would be nice. In its absence, I will re-read the book and take notes. If none of the above interests you, just read it because it is entertaining! 2005-10-07

Mr. Saffer's light humor and cultural observations pepper this story of his globe-trotting quest for ancient bricks.

US 33347828 R1DHAWEI7X1A50 0553588117 370772762 Prince of the Blood, 15th Anniversary Edition Books 5 3 4 N N Feist keeps on ticking Prince of the Blood by Raymond Feist, continues on the story told in the Rift War saga. However, there are some new characters to be introduced as it is 20 years after that event Prince Arutha now has twin boys and this story follows them. This story is a departure from Feist's earlier books in this series as there is very little magic in it. In Prince of the Blood the main driving force of the book is politics and intrigue, it almost has the feel of a who-done-it type plot. Normally I don't like the who-done-it books but Feist was able to pull this off with a well developed setting, great characters, and a plot that seemed to always keep you guessing.<br /><br />The characters development in this is again very good, as can be expected with Feist. Since I have started reading Feist's books I have been rather impressed by how well thought-out his characters are. There seems to be very little that is done just for the sake of doing. Each character remains consistent throughout the story, and more impressively, throughout the series. This book centers on the development of two characters, those being the sons of the prince. Each faces different challenges and pitfalls along the way. Each is faced with a different set of circumstances that force them to make decisions. These decisions go a long way in there development. With all of the Feist books I have read thus far, he has a knack for letting his characters show flaws. They are not these all powerful people that some authors have as their characters. The characters in this book get hurt, have doubts, and one goes through a lot by the end of the book.<br /><br />At the start of this book I thought the plot was going to be rather straight forward and almost boring. Yet, the more I read the more complex the plot became. By the last 100 pages of this book the plot is so involved you are not even sure who to believe or at time exactly what even happened (or is going to happen). By the end of the book however, everything is brought to a nice close and it all makes sense. I think a great benefit for this plot is the setting which is richly described and used to its fullest to get the greatest effect.<br /><br />Feist is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors for his ability to weave a good story with good characters. It seems all too often most authors have one or the other and expect it to carry the book - while that can certainly be done - it's much more interesting when both elements are present. If you are a fan of the fantasy genre and have yet to read this book (or any other Feist books) you really should take the time and do so. Remember, to start at the beginning with Magician: Apprentice and follow it through. I think if one were to read this book first you may be a little confused, but not overly much so. All-in-all I highly recommend this. I think it's a must for any fan of the genreng is brought to a nice close and it all makes sense.

US 32893147 R149NG47AKYS1D 0525675418 731538357 The Sin Eater Books 5 2 2 N N Sin Eater Overall I was very pleased with this book. Being familiar with the myth of the \\"Sin Eater\\", I was very excited about the topic of what I thought the book would present. After reading about one third of the way through however, I found it slightly odd and frankly disappointing that there had been only a brief sentence or two about a sin eater which appeared within the first chapter of the book. Not to be swayed, however, the book up to that point was filled with emotion and heartache. A young boy and his father return to the family farm after his mother's funeral to start a new life with his grandparents. There is an emptiness that rings through that pages that anyone can take to heart. Cole, the now motherless boy, narrates the text filled with daydreamed memories and a mournful spirit. <br /> Cole is not the only the reader routes for throughout the book. The grandparents are overflowing with a familiarity to my own family that is difficult to overlook. The language that Schmidt uses in anything from dialogue to description is precise and easy to relate to. The images that he paints with words almost pop in the head without purposeful thought. <br /> I did find the plot to move quite slowly for the first 100 pages or so. Although the background and daily observations were necessary to tie the whole story together, I did find myself aching for action. Although the title of the book leads one to believe Schmidt will tell a glorified tale of a real and local sin eater, that is not the case. That may leave some disappointment, but the book adds the myth just enough to flavor the true plot. The novel also brings in minor plots about making friends, being compassionate and trying to make the best out of heartache and sorrow. <br /> Throughout the novel Cole discovers a story about a sin eater who in fact lived on the very same farm he was living on generations ago. The tale of the sin eater leads Cole through a search on his own ancestors. He discoversa generation full of guilt and grudges. He is able to personalize his own feelings of guilt and pain in the memory and stories of his ancestors. Just when the reader has felt enough pain on the behalf of Cole, Schmidt adds a suicide of Cole's father that brings the reader to tears. Schmidt sets the stage and story in such a way that the reader feels the same anger and confusion as Cole. The reader is left in shock and asking why, although they should have seen it coming. <br /> Although the story is woven in pain, it gives the reader a boy reveling in his own family history to find a way to release his own guilt and anger. In the end, Cole uses the story of the sin eater who loosed the guilt of an ancestor and his adopted son to rid Cole of his own guilt and anger toward the loss of his parents. <br /> 2005-10-13

He was a teacher of English before he became a professional writer and thus he brings credentials to this book about language and linguistics. \\"Mouthful of Air\\" is written for British readers and Americans may find some of the discussions of British pronunciation a bit esoteric and mysterious. Being a sloppy-voweled American I didn't really comprehend the subtle differences the author perceives in pronunciation of the words \\"marry merry Mary,\\" for example. They sound the same to me. Thus, his technical discussions of vowel differences did not resonate in differing vibrations to my inner ear. I would likewise question the author's opinion that the phonetic alphabet should be required learning in school. That would be about as useful as reinstituting Latin as a required course. Burgess divides his book into two parts. Part one deals with technical aspects of language. For example, he titles one graphic, \\"Chart of Consonants According to their Organs of Articulation.\\" The consonants are then divided into stop plosives, nasals, laterals, fricatives, glides, and affricates. Whew! I don't think I would want to be in an English class with Burgess as a teacher. Amongst discussion of affricates and fricatives, however, are some interesting chapters on the development of the Indo-European tongues and brief chapters on Malay and Japanese to show how they differ from Indo-European languages. Part two is about English -- mostly British English, but also American, Australian, and Scottish. He briefly examines dialects, literature, \\"low life\\" language, and the influence of the Bible on language. A minority of people will find his technical discussions instructive. The author defines his objective as pedagogic and the reader should expect some hard sledding if he wishes to comprehend every last word in this book. However, I suspect that the majority of us will skip blithely over words like \\"alveolar\\" and enjoy the rest of the book -- which is informative and fascinating. Smallchief 2005-10-04

They are best friends `til the end, living, loving and sometimes losing in the land where no one walks. Their love lives seem to be moving forward in a positive fashion and yet, both of them get little hints that not all that glitters is gold. Eric paints a true-to-life picture of women trying to understand the men in their lives. From love-to-hate characters like Deja's hard-on-the-outside-but-kinda-soft on-the-inside brother, Theron, who breezes in and out of her life like the wind; Isrie's ex-boyfriend Ryan a record producer, who is prettier than most women are and unfortunately knows it; and her new man Michael who seems too good to be true and probably is; to Ivan the model, who just wants a regular girl like Deja (or so it seems); as well as parents who stay on Isrie's case about finding a man and settling down. Twisted makes you immediately feel like you know these people. <br /> <br />The sex was raw and brazen with a touch of humor, as it should be. The language was, at times, fresh, foul, and funny all at once, and the characters were appealing, irritating, and real, as they should be. All these ingredients are vintage Eric Pete, but what sets Twisted apart is how Eric captured the sheer essence of real black women as they interact in their daily lives. He has done much to counter the myth of the strong black woman and showed how sensitive, vulnerable, feminine and pure we really are. Eric touched on the little things that women notice, like the way a man's goatee curls when he smiles. Or how we can size up a woman and know when a man has been intimate with her. He also sensitively deals with issues like body image, date rape, and domestic abuse, things women deal with on the regular. <br /> <br />It feels odd saying these things about a man writing from a woman's perspective, but truth be told, Eric simply gets it. Moreover, he captured our passion, our humor, and lust for life and a few other things as well! After getting to know these engaging characters, the story almost didn't matter because I can always depend on Eric to give me a good story with lots of twists and turns and Twisted didn't disappoint me, believe that! Nevertheless, what truly blew me away was the fact that I was left with the feeling that there is at least one man out there who knows the heart of black women, a comforting thought indeed. Well done, Eric! <br /> 2005-10-11

US 24821538 RMM5RVCRH5ERN 1573452513 881430011 Trail of Hope: The Story of the Mormon Trail, Companion to the PBS Documentary Books 4 14 14 N N A seemingly objective history of a nation-shaping exodus In the early-1800s, the Mormon Church--or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as it's formally called--was founded when a young man named Joseph Smith, not even twenty years old, produced a book he said had been translated with divine help from an ancient record found buried on a hill near his family's New York farm. The book, \\"The Book of Mormon,\\" told the story of two cultures, the Nephites and the Lamanites, that lived in the Americas during the time of Christ, and claimed that Jesus had appeared to those cultures after his resurrection. (Many Mormons believe today's Native Americans are the descendants of those cultures.)<br /><br />Joseph Smith said he received the book after he prayed to find out which church to join, and that God and Jesus Christ appeared to him themselves and told him not to join any of them. The Mormon Church grew quickly, with Joseph Smith as its leader, but as it grew, it gained enemies. People resented Joseph Smith's claims, covered him in tar and feathers, and violently tormented his followers. The Mormons moved from place to place: to Ohio, to Missouri, and to Illinois, building settlements and towns, and fleeing when enraged mobs burnt down the Mormons' homes and churches or massacred the Mormon men and boys. The Governor of Missouri went as far as issuing a military order for the complete extermination or deportation of every Mormon within his state. Eventually, Joseph Smith was assassinated by a mob, through the windows of an Illinois prison, where he was being held for ordering the destruction of the printing presses of an anti-Mormon newspaper.<br /><br />Most people thought Joseph's Smith death would be the end of the Mormons, but it merely made him a martyr for his people. Brigham Young, a tough, fiery-tempered man, became the Mormons' second leader--their second prophet--and in the mid-1800s, led the Mormons westward, toward what was then Mexican territory, and is now the state of Utah. The Mormons traveled in covered wagons, or pulled wooden handcarts, and large numbers of them died from cold, hunger, sickness, and Indian attacks. Along the way they built towns and outposts, and gave English names to the mountains and rivers.<br /><br />This book is the story of that journey, and it's a well told account of it. The book is full of beautiful and historic photos, as well as copies of letters and journal entries, and a good narrative that ties it all together and injects new and little known facts into a story familiar to many. This is a great book for any interested in the history of the West. It seems objective, though it comes from a Mormon-owned publishing company, and it's never boring. It's one of the best books on the Mormon pioneers I've ever read, and I recommend it highly.overed wagons, or pulled wooden handcarts, and large numbers of them died from cold, hunger, sickness, and Indian attacks.

A sales tax would be a regressive tax; i.e. low-income individuals would pay a much higher share of their incomes than wealthy individuals. <br /> <br />2. A national sales tax is a risky system that may not raise near enough money to support all our needs in defense, education, health care, etc. <br /> <br />3. Consumer spending, which drives a thriving economy, would likely drop as people save and invest more rather than spend. <br />Many incentives built into our tax system (such as education, home ownership, charity, etc.) would be eliminated. <br /> <br />4. Hundreds of thousands of attorneys, accountants, and human resource workers would likely lose their jobs due to the simpler tax system. <br /> <br />5. Real estate values would likely plummet since the tax advantages to ownership would vanish. <br /> <br />6. Mortgage and other consumer debt would likely explode since consumers would be forced to finance the taxes also. <br /> <br />7. We would have to come up with another way to raise or set aside funds for social security. <br /> <br />8. The transition costs of such a change would be extremely expensive. <br /> <br />9. Tax evasion and instances of black market purchasing would likely skyrocket. <br /> <br />10. Consumer prices of many items would go up by a much greater rate than the sales tax rate since raw materials would also be taxed. <br /> <br />11. Retirees and others who have earned the majority of their life income have already had their money hit with income tax; thus, they will pay extra sales tax with money already subjected to income tax. <br /> <br />...and... <br /> <br />12. A sales tax is more insidious; i.e. it's easier for the government to raise taxes without the people knowing it, as opposed to an income tax which shows up on the W2's and 1040's every year. <br /> 2005-10-02

(4 1/2 stars) I have to agree with Charlene Austin and the Editorial Reviews. This is a fascinating book- the concept is great, and the book tackles some difficult issues that- frankly- I hadn't bothered to consider until now. With all the medical advances being made nowadays, the premise of Wakely's story is not beyond the realm of possibility, which is easily the most frightening thing about the book. I wish I could say the dilemma the book raises (most convincingly argued in Chapter 28 by the professor and the doctor) has a simple right/wrong solution, but it doesn't. I too thought about all the implications after finishing the book. Our science and society is barreling ahead with discoveries that have profound ethical and moral implications, and we seem ill prepared to deal with the consequences. The genie is out of the bottle, and nobody can put it back. Some might even say we're barreling ahead out of control, and they could very well be right. For the clever way Wakely brings those implications to our attention, I give An Audience for Einstein a recommendation. It's a solid \\"think piece\\" I'm glad I read. 2005-10-04

So in this sense, I find the book familiar and a delight. <br /> <br />Many a review have labelled \\"Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell\\" as Harry Potter for adults. I've read all 6 Harry Potters, so I will have to disagree and say an empathic no. <br /> <br />There is no fast paced magical action in this book, certainly no hair raising manouvers on broomsticks, dramatic pronouncements of spells, severe wand pointings nor bubbling potions in magical couldrons. Everything takes a much somber, grey and deliberate mood - as befitting English Victorian sensibilities. Next to Harry Potter, watching magic here is like watching donkey carts racing! Yes, you have to be really committed (or desperate) to find it exciting. But the results can be quite dramatic! If only Harry laid his hands on that raising-the-dead spell! <br /> <br />The book is heavy on the history of magic - sometimes the book reads like a history book (zzzzz.....). Details and more details. Beware: tons of page notes! However I can see the point - they serve to make the story very excitingly rich. But the writer has managed to create a fine line between that and being mindnumbingly boring! <br /> <br /> <br />The excitment comes really from the many interesting plots that are built layer upon layer of each other. The author is big on details and in the beginning this makes the book enjoyable to read. However as the plot thickens (not as thick as the book), this incesant detailing by the author just becomes plain irritating. Clarke can't seem to stop herself and I only wished the editor would've done a better job here. Despite the similarity in style Clarke is nowhere near Dickens' league as a skillful storyteller. Why do writers keep forgetting that restrain is a virtue! <br /> <br />The book ends with a cliffhanger and thus setting a possible sequel. Despite the tedious slog at the end, I would read the follow-up if only to see the tale of these hapless magicians through to a happy conclusion. But I hope the editor does a better job next time 'round. 2005-09-28
